# TV Script Generator
---

This project generates Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs, especially LSTMs. Just by using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons, the neural network will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

Generated TV script doesn't make any sense. I trained on less than a megabyte of text. However, sometimes it can create some funny conversations.
